# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes California housing data to build predictive models in order to determine the median house value. In this data science project, I cleaned and explored the data (in the IDA and EDA notebooks) and used that for pipeline creation. Then after this I fitted the data for 4 regression types: Linear, decision tree, random forest regression, SVR.
